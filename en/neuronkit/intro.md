# NeuronKit (Agentic Context SDK)

NeuronKit is a middleware SDK that brings agentic capabilities to existing mobile and IoT apps. It collects rich device context and enforces safe on-device actions via a capability-based sandbox. Inference happens in the cloud; actions execute securely on the device. Your app becomes a “neuron” in a larger agentic system.

— In short: cloud brain, device hands; privacy-first, policy-controlled, and human-in-the-loop.

## Overview: Why NeuronKit

- __Context is intelligence__. Modern AI quality depends on context. NeuronKit continuously gathers device-side context and organizes it into semantic, episodic, and procedural memory so agents stay coherent and relevant across sessions.
- __From clickstream to dialog stream__. Users increasingly prefer conversational UX. NeuronKit adds a dialog layer (text/voice) with embedded UI so users can talk and tap through tasks in the same flow.
- __Action execution at the edge__. Many agent frameworks run tool calls in the cloud. NeuronKit’s on-device sandbox executes actions locally, enforcing consent, least privilege, and full auditability.
- __Drop-in for legacy apps__. Integrate as middleware with minimal code changes. Register app features as capabilities, and NeuronKit handles context streaming, policy checks, and UI components.
- __Built for developers and enterprises__. Simple APIs for engineers, plus enterprise controls for compliance, observability, and policy governance.

## Key Features

- __Rich context collection__. Capture device signals (location, sensors, telemetry, clickstream) as scenario context for agent reasoning.
- __Secure on-device sandbox__. Capability-based PDP/PEP with consent, least privilege, rate limits, and audit trails.
- __Cloud memory server__. Time-ordered logs promoted into semantic, episodic, and procedural memories for continuity and personalization.
- __Agent integration__. Route intents to agents; execute their action plans against registered capabilities in the sandbox.
- __ConvoUI__. Natural language (text/voice) with embedded UI widgets (buttons, forms, tiles) in the dialog stream.
- __Platform-agnostic__. Android / iOS / IoT friendly; cloud-neutral.
- __Extensible__. Tune policies, prompts, retention, and themes to your needs.

## Benefits

- __Future-proof UX__. Prepare for the shift to conversational, context-aware experiences across commerce, IoT, and enterprise apps.
- __Privacy and control__. Keep sensitive data on-device; send only intents and sanitized context upstream. Enforce consent and least privilege.
- __Faster time-to-value__. Drop-in middleware; no need to build custom agent infrastructure or policy engines from scratch.
- __Higher engagement__. Conversational UI plus context personalization drives better outcomes than static click flows.

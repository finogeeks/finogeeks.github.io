## Sandboxing for Agentic Systems — A Technical White Paper

## Executive summary

Agentic systems — software that uses models to plan, decide, and act (often by executing scripts or controlling UIs) — amplify both capability and risk. Running untrusted agent-generated actions (code, browser automation, file operations, network requests) requires strong, well-architected isolation so that a single malicious or buggy agent cannot escalate to a full system compromise or data exfiltration.

This white paper introduces a practical taxonomy of sandboxing approaches relevant to agentic systems, compares trade-offs (security, performance, developer ergonomics), describes concrete architecture patterns (including the common cloud-decision / local-executor split for browser agents), and gives recommendations for choosing and composing sandbox techniques in production. Key references and real-world primitives (microVMs, containers + seccomp, WebAssembly, browser sandboxes, capability-based controls, and NeuronKit) are cited and linked for readers who want to implement or evaluate designs.

## 1. Introduction: why sandboxing matters for agents

Agentic systems can generate or orchestrate actions that reach beyond pure text: they may synthesize code, click through web pages, use stored credentials, or manipulate local files. That capability creates these core hazards:

- **Untrusted-code execution**: agents may generate or receive code that must be executed (e.g., Python/JS snippets).
- **Data exfiltration**: instructions that read tokens, cookies, or files and send them to remote endpoints.
- **Privilege escalation / lateral movement**: one agent process should not be able to compromise co-tenants or host.
- **Supply-chain / persistence risks**: a benign-looking action (installing a package or browser extension) can create long-term attack surface.

Sandboxing reduces these risks by bounding what code can do and what resources it can access.

---

## 2. Threat model (short)

When evaluating sandboxes for agents, make explicit the assumed threats:

- **Host compromise by agent** (goal: run arbitrary native code / access host kernel).  
- **Data leakage** (goal: exfiltrate secrets / cookies / files).  
- **Cross-tenant attacks** (in multi-tenant cloud: one tenant affecting another).  
- **Supply-chain attacks** (agent causes installation of persistent backdoor).  
- **UI manipulation & phishing** (agent-controlled browser UI tricks user).

A sandbox’s design must be driven by which of these threats are in scope.

## 3. Taxonomy of sandbox categories

### 3.1 Hardware/VM-level sandboxes (VMs & microVMs)

**Description.**  
Full kernel-level isolation using virtualization. MicroVMs (e.g., Firecracker) are minimal VMMs optimized for short-lived workloads with low overhead and strong isolation.

**Strengths**  

- Strong isolation: kernel boundary prevents most host compromise vectors.  
- Mature attack surface model; easy to reason about tenancy separation.  

**Weaknesses**  

- Higher resource cost and startup latency than in-process solutions.  
- More operational complexity (images, orchestration).  

**When to use**  

- Running fully untrusted agent-generated code at scale.  
- Scenarios that require kernel separation (arbitrary native code execution).  

---

### 3.2 Container-level sandboxes + kernel policies

**Description.**  
Lightweight OS-level isolation (namespaces, cgroups) augmented with kernel filters (seccomp), LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux), and runtime sandboxes (gVisor, Kata Containers).

**Strengths**  

- Good performance and tooling ecosystem.  
- Fine-grained kernel-level control possible.  

**Weaknesses**  

- Weaker isolation than full VMs if kernel bugs or escapes exist.  
- Complex to configure correctly for absolute safety.  

**When to use**  

- Medium-risk workloads where performance matters with kernel-level hardening.  

---

### 3.3 Language/runtime-level sandboxes (WebAssembly, SFI)

**Description.**  
Execution in a language VM or via software fault isolation inside a process. WebAssembly (Wasm) is a portable, sandboxed binary format designed for running untrusted code with a constrained host interface.

**Strengths**  

- Very low startup latency; small resource footprint.  
- Strong capability discipline.  
- Good for language-agnostic plugin ecosystems.  

**Weaknesses**  

- Isolation is limited to process scope; host runtime bugs can be abused.  
- Wasm itself has security considerations.  

**When to use**  

- Plugin models, sandboxing algorithms, in-browser execution.  

---

### 3.4 Browser-level sandboxes (same-origin, iframe sandbox, CSP)

**Description.**  
Browsers implement multi-layer isolation: same-origin policy, site isolation, iframe sandbox attribute, CSP, and extension sandboxing.

**Strengths**  

- Designed to limit web content and cross-site data flow.  
- Good for agentic UI automation limited to DOM and browser APIs.  

**Weaknesses**  

- Extension permissions can be abused.  
- Requires strict permission minimization.  

**When to use**  

- Running agentic automation inside the browser.  

---

### 3.5 Process & kernel primitives (seccomp, namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, pledge/jail)

**Description.**  
Additional knobs to harden containers/processes: block syscalls, limit capabilities, apply LSM policies, or use OS-level jail mechanisms.

**Strengths**  

- Granular control over resources.  
- Works inside containers/microVMs.  

**Weaknesses**  

- Requires meticulous policy engineering.  

**When to use**  

- As complementary controls for containers or processes.  

---

### 3.6 Capability-based and policy enforcement sandboxes

**Description.**  
Expose narrowly scoped capabilities (tokens/handles) that grant specific actions, reducing ambient authority.

**Strengths**  

- Strong principle of least privilege.  
- Fine-grained auditability.  

**Weaknesses**  

- Requires redesign of host APIs.  

**When to use**  

- Plugin ecosystems, browser agents with limited actions.  

---

### 3.7 Semantic/Intent-Governed Sandboxes (application-level)

**Description.**  
A distinct class of sandboxing where the boundary is not at the kernel, process, or runtime, but at the application’s semantic layer. The sandbox constrains what the agent can intend (e.g., “click button X,” “send payment Y”) rather than how code executes. This model is especially relevant for mobile apps, superapps, IoT, and embedded agents, where OS-level sandboxes exist but do not mediate AI-driven intent. It mediates **semantic actions** through a **policy-driven capability model**.

It combines:  

- **Cloud-side decisioning**: agent plans actions.  
- **Local enforcement**: a browser-embedded DSL interpreter executes only permitted steps.  
- **Capability tokens**: minimal, time-boxed, least-privilege capabilities.  
- **Isolation layering**: sits inside the browser sandbox while exposing only explicit, policy-approved actions.  

**Strengths.**

- Fine-grained mediation of user-facing actions.
- Lightweight (no VM/container overhead).
- Natural fit for capability-token models and human-in-the-loop approvals.
- Bridges cloud planning with local, trusted enforcement.

**Weaknesses.**

- Depends on correctness of DSL/policy engine.
- No kernel-level barrier.
- Policy engineering complexity.

**When to use.**

- Agentic systems embedded in mobile apps, IoT devices, or superapps.
- Situations where semantic safety (what the agent does) matters more than syscall safety (how it runs).
- As a complement to heavier compute isolation (VMs/Wasm).

## 4. Architectures & design patterns

### 4.1 Cloud decision, local execution  

- Cloud agent plans; local executor enforces via DSL.  
- Cloud never receives raw secrets.  
- Local executor = Policy Enforcement Point.  

### 4.2 Instruction DSL + capability tokens  

- Define auditable DSL with typed parameters.  
- Short-lived capability tokens for resources.  
- Never run arbitrary eval.  

### 4.3 Two-layer sandbox: Wasm in microVM  

- Wasm for plugin safety + microVM for kernel protection.  

### 4.4 Ephemeral-per-task sandboxes  

- Fresh environment per task; destroyed after execution.  

---

## 5. Enforcement, auditing & governance

- **Policy Decision & Enforcement:** PDP in cloud; PEP local.  
- **Observability & tamper resistance:** signed logs, append-only, replayable traces.  
- **Least privilege & expiry:** short-lived capabilities.  
- **Human-in-the-loop:** confirmation for irreversible actions.  

---

## 6. Evaluation criteria

- Isolation strength.  
- Attack surface.  
- Performance & latency.  
- Developer ergonomics.  
- Operational cost.  
- Auditability.  

---

## 7. Practical recommendations

1. Classify actions by risk (low/medium/high).  
2. Adopt cloud-decision / local-executor for browser agents.  
3. For server code: microVMs (fully untrusted), Wasm (plugin models), or hybrid.  
4. Apply kernel primitives everywhere.  
5. Design host APIs around capabilities.  
6. Instrument for audit & forensics.  
7. Maintain sandbox lifecycle as ongoing practice.  
8. For UI-driven agent systems, prefer **semantic sandboxes like NeuronKit** over raw JS execution.  

---

## 8. Case examples & references

- **Firecracker / microVMs**: lightweight strong isolation.  
- **Containers + seccomp**: pragmatic server-side sandboxing.  
- **Wasmtime / WebAssembly**: portable runtime with capability APIs.  
- **Browser sandbox & extension risks**: CSP, extension isolation, permission minimization.  
- **NeuronKit Sandbox**: practical semantic sandbox for agent–UI interaction.  

---

## 9. Future directions

- Provable SFI & formally verified runtimes.  
- Hardware-backed isolation (TEEs / SGX / SEV).  
- Capability OS & microkernels.  
- Standardized agent DSL + signed capability tokens.  

---

## 10. Conclusion

Agentic systems are powerful but risky. There is no single “best” sandbox; instead, adopt a layered approach:

- Browser sandboxes + local PEP for UIs.  
- Ephemeral microVMs for untrusted server code.  
- Wasm + capability APIs for plugin models.  
- NeuronKit for semantic enforcement in browser automation.  

Assume agent outputs may be malicious. Minimize ambient authority, enforce capabilities, require user confirmation for risky actions, and maintain auditable trails.
